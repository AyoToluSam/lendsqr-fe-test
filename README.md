* Jest

## Key Features

* **A Login page**, containing a login form.
The form accepts any dummy input, and on click of the login button, it links to the dashboard page.

* **The Dashboard page**, displaying a table of data of some users, 10 users per page. There is a navigation at the bottom to jump to pages.

* **View Details Popup**, shows when the ellipsis in the last column of the table is clicked. The "View Details" link in the popup list navigates to the details page for the user data on that row.

* **The details page for each user**, containing elaborated information about each user from the table.
